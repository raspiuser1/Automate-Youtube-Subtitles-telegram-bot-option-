Past Wezet, the Meuse reaches the Netherlands at
Eijsden and forms the border between the province
of LiÃ¨ge and Dutch Limburg up to Maastricht. It
runs here through the Maas valley with the Plateau
van Caestert on the west side and the terraces and
the Plateau van Margraten on the east side. After
Maastricht, the Meuse forms the border between
Belgian Limburg and Dutch Limburg. This part of
the Maas is known as the Grensmaas and is located
between Maastricht-Smeermaas and Kessenich. The
Maas meanders a lot and has been replaced by
lateral canals for shipping purposes: the
Zuid-Willemsvaart, the Juliana Canal and the
Lateraal Canal. East of the Grensmaas in South
Limburg lies the Central Plateau and the Plateau
van Graetheide.
