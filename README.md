# Automate your Youtube Subtitles (with telegram bot)

Boost your youtube video? Than its time to use subtitles.
This script makes it a lot easier to create a subtitle in a few seconds from plain text in every language.

Normally if you have a standard text (in a non-English language) you first have to run it through google translate and then save it as a text file, you have to load it at youtube studio and then adjust the timing.
Then YouTube will determine the timing of the subtitles itself and this can take a while, after that then you have to adjust the timing of these subtitles yourself because its never good and its time consuming if you have a longer video.
